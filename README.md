# VS Code Tricks and Tips

This is a bare-bones guide to using your favorite text editor. I have been digging deep into (reading individual settings, line by line) VS Code for a couple of weeks, and read too many articles to care for. I hope to bring some tips and tricks that we can all utilize during our cohort! If you have suggestions, please make a pull request (I'll figure git out soon).

#### My Motivation

I suffer from moderate RSI that primarily resulted from a freak shoulder injury. Initially, I was not able to use my hands at all for a couple of months. Long story short, June 2020 marks my 25th month of my battle with RSI. I have tried everything under the sun to limit the usage of my arms and to stay functional. Crazy how now I am in the midst of frantically preparing for Codesmith (LA Cohort 37). Despite my fear of hurting myself again, I've fully committed to utilizing and learning as many hotkeys and shortcuts I can. Hopefully, you too will be able to put this resource to good use!

## Resources

Microsoft's [official guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) will always be the canonical source. Stackoverflow and its subdirectory, such as [superuser](https://superuser.com/), have some serious power users but may be too technical and erudite for fledglings like us.

## Ok, how do I really set up Airbnb Config?

Here's **[relatively recent Medium Article](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/set-up-react-js-with-eslint-prettier-and-airbnb-cc015363a7c7)** and **[a Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SydnKbGc7W8&t=3s)**. You don't need to create react app (I've only ran the command a couple of times) to completely set up an airbnb linting config. I'll try to be as succint as possible, and hopefully, you'll have your perfect combination ready to go so you can focus on the code.
